## Codeforces Contest review - Codeforces Round 1014

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*well, that was weird...*

### Problem A. Kamilka and the Sheep [(2092A)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2092/problem/A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decent problem for this position. It only requires a little bit of number theory, after that it becomes quite straightforward.

### Problem B. Lady Bug [(2092B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2092/problem/B)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swap operations may look a bit scary, but it is quite simple. We only need to be careful about the conditions for two bit strings to satisfy the conditions of the problem, but overall not much issue here.

### Problem C. Asuna and the Mosquitoes [(2092C)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2092/problem/C)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite rare to see a Div.2 contest that has $3$ math problems for ABC. The difficulty assigned to this problem was only $1200$, which is quite low for a standard Div.2C in my opinion. Again, we only need one good observation to solve this problem, which is to focus on the parity of the numbers, counting the amount of odd numbers.

### Problem E. She knows... [(2092E)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2092/problem/E)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Another math problem? Really?*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition that $|A|$ must be even immediately leads to the idea of considering the count modulo $2$. Indeed, at that point, we can quickly see that we only need to focus on the squares that are on the edges, but are not the corners.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually expected more for a problem of this difficulty - it is assigned to be a Div.2E, after all - rather than just another one observation problem. To be honest, anyone who has a good background in Maths can solve ABCE quite easily.

### Problem D. Mishkin Energizer [(2092D)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2092/problem/D)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attempted to solve this after solving E, but I didn't have a good time with it. The strings made it quite difficult to implement the algorithm properly, and debugging took forever, and I eventually gave up after $3$ failed attempts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I don't think this contest reflected my abilities very well. Four of the problems were mostly Maths, which I am good at, so I got quite lucky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This is mostly my personal experience with the problems, you might not completely agree with some of the things here. Please do not make this an excuse to attack me and/or anyone who was involved in the making of this contest.
