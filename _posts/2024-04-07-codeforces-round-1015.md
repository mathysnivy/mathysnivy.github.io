## Codeforces Contest review - Codeforces Round 1015

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*back to where I belong...*

### Problem A. Max and Mod [(2084A)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2084/problem/A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice problem to start off - not too easy, but not too difficult. Constructing from the back will give us the answer relatively quickly.

### Problem B. Lady Bug [(2084B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2084/problem/B)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is quite obvious from the start - the gcd should be the minimum element. After that, there is not much trouble checking if the conditions are satisfied for an array.

### Problem C. Asuna and the Mosquitoes [(2092C)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2084/problem/C)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem was mostly implementation. Note that since the numbers in the two arrays basically come in pairs, we can make $n$ pairs of the form $(a_i, b_i)$. Then, we try to construct a possible solution, and finally we try to achieve that in $n$ steps, by changing the elements one-by-one. This was very implementation-heavy, though (at least for my experience), so I got slowed down quite a bit.

### Problem D. Arcology On Permafrost [(2084D)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2084/problem/D)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don't know why I couldn't solve this problem. I believe that I have found all needed observations, but somehow I couldn't find the correct formula for $f(a)$. This basically marked the end of the contest for me - I couldn't get past D, and problems E onwards were out of my range.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I was on vacation, and had to code on a phone for ABC, I still think it is inexcusable that I didn't solve D. The next contest is in at least 2 weeks, so I will have some time to rest and try to do better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This is mostly my personal experience with the problems, you might not completely agree with some of the things here. Please do not make this an excuse to attack me and/or anyone who was involved in the making of this contest.
