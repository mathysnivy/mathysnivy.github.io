## Codeforces Contest review - Codeforces Round 1007

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*oh no, not this again...*

### Problem A. The Play Never Ends [(2071A)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2071/problem/A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a trolly problem to start out. Some short reasoning will give us that the answer is "YES" only if $k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, not much to talk about here.

### Problem B. Perfecto [(2071B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2071/problem/B)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for this basically relies on the fact that there aren't two consecutive numbers, both larger than $1$, that are both a perfect square, so we can check which option works. Quite a nice constructive problem, but it may take some time to figure out the main idea.

### Problem D1. Infinite Sequence (Easy Version) [(2071D1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2071/problem/D1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*when you can't solve C, so you try D instead...*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too difficult of a problem, to me maybe easier than C. For this problem, the important part is noticing that $a_{2k} = a_{2k+1}$ starting from some $k,$ so to compute a number with a big index in the sequence, we can at least reduce the index by a factor of $2$.

### Problem C. Trapmigiano Reggiano [(2071C)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2071/problem/C)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't think this problem would be hard, but turns out I didn't even manage to solve it. I spent about an hour getting a few different ideas on the strategy, but some of them were probably impossible (for me, at least) to implement, so I never tried out on any of those. The solution is actually very clever, and I would recommend trying this problem out, but I guess I wasn't having a great day with trees then.

The blunder on problem C resulted in my rank being around the $1600$ mark, which was not very good for my skills. My rating went down by $39$, which is, to be honest, quite deserved for this contest. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This is mostly my personal experience with the problems, you might not completely agree with some of the things here. Please do not make this an excuse to attack me and/or anyone who was involved in the making of this contest.
